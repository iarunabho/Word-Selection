# Word-Selection
The code can be used to do multiple word selection based on the mouse pointer.

I've rewritten this to actually (mostly) work now. Unfortunately, the selection expansion is too greedy in non-IE and expands the selection to the next word if a whole word is already selected, but I can't see an easy way round this at the moment.
